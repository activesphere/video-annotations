## Video Annotator

Take notes while watching a Youtube video.

#### Markdown status

Supporting something like "markdown-lite". Bold, italic, underline, headers,
blockquote. Markdown is previewed but the markdown symbols themselves are also
shown in the preview.

#### Video timestamps

You can place timestamp links in the document and seek to that time in the
corresponding video.
