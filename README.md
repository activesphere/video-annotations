## Video Annotator

Take notes while watching a YouTube video.

#### Markdown status

Supporting something like "markdown-lite". Bold, italic, underline, headers,
bullet-list, code. Markdown is previewed but the markdown symbols themselves
are also shown in the preview so that you can copy paste into some markdown to
html/pdf converter or another text editor.

#### Video timestamps

You can place timestamp links in the document and seek to that time in the
corresponding video.

Run the app to see the key sequences that control the video and place
timestamps into the editor.

#### Saved notes

Notes are saved per video.
