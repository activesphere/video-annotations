## This app is under rapid development not ready for use yet

## Annotate videos

A chrome extension to annotate videos & share it with others via dropbox
Ideal for creating indices for educational content

## Local Setup

```
npm install
bower install
webpack
```

## TODO

### Major
- Share annotations over dropbox
- Publish publicly over a URL

### Minor
- Resizable sidebar width
- Option to highlight annotation on playback

### Cleanup
- Break up less into smaller chunks
- Use ES6 classes instead of Backbone.extend
- Use bower for all vendor stuff
