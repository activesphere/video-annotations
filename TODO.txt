#### Better saving (important)

* Save notes with a name. Doesn't have to be per-video. Show a simple dialog
when user wants to save.

* A load menu. Show a modal menu (like Sublime text's) and enable fuzzy
(longest subsequence)searching for notes with note-name, video-id, or video
name


#### CSS fixes (important)

Using flexbox stretches the video player div when user starts writing more
that one screen-height worth of text.


#### More edit options

* Support arbitrary hyperlinks (with slate paste link plugin)
* Add full markdown support


#### Test Video ID
