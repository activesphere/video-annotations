#### Better saving

* Save notes with a name. Doesn't have to be per-video. Show a simple dialog
when user wants to save.


#### CSS fixes (important)

* A better look won't hurt. Will have to up my design game.

#### More edit options

* Support arbitrary hyperlinks (with slate paste link plugin)

* Add mathjax formulas in editor. Take a context input and place the formula in the editor. Directly placing
formulas into editor as the user types is a complicated due to the way these editor libraries are designed.

* Add full markdown support

* Implement `Add Timestamp` and `Add current timestamp` in the context menu.
