#### Better saving (important)

* Save notes with a name. Doesn't have to be per-video. Show a simple dialog
when user wants to save.

* A load menu. Show a modal menu (like Sublime text's) and enable fuzzy
(longest subsequence)searching for notes with note-name, video-id, or video
name


#### CSS fixes (important)

Using flexbox stretches the video player div when user starts writing more
that one screen-height worth of text.


#### More edit options

* Support arbitrary hyperlinks (with slate paste link plugin)

* Place video data (title and id) into editor with a hotkey.

* Add full markdown support

* Add current time to a list of stored timestamps. Use these timestamps later.
When doing so, pause the video, get a name for the timestamp, store it in a
list, and continue the video.
