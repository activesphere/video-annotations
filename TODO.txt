#### Better saving

* Save notes with a name. Doesn't have to be per-video. Show a simple dialog
when user wants to save.

#### More edit options

* Support arbitrary hyperlinks (with slate paste link plugin)

* Add mathjax formulas in editor. Take a context input and place the formula in the editor. Directly placing
formulas into editor as the user types is a complicated due to the way these editor libraries are designed.

* Add full markdown support

* Implement `Add Timestamp` and `Add current timestamp` in the context menu.


#### Editing experience

* Implement following (Important)

On every change of cursor, check if the cursor is on a timestamp mark. If so, toggle away the
timestamp mark from currently activated timestamp.


#### Extension

If user clicks the extension button more than once, there's multiple inject scripts running. Each does the same work per message - like capturing the same frame and sending it to app. This needs to be fixed.
