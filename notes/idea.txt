Hotkeys
-----------------------

Taking cursor inside a link and pressing Ctrl+g will take you to that
timepoint of the video.


Key sequence syntax
-----------------------

Stored in keysequences.js file. One thing I want to add is the ability to not
just put arbitrary text in the timestamp as opposed to just the hhmmss format
time. Should be simple to to.


Extension style
-----------------------

I'm thinking all we should do is open a new window with the currently playing
youtube video in an iframe? It's the simplest way to get the functionality in.


I can get fancier like insert that editor component right in the youtube page,
but that.. is probably better to do after I get my hands dirty with chrome
extension api first.
